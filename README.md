## How to Test HW

To test a notebook log onto [edX edge studio](https://studio.edge.edx.org) then go to the programming assignment that you want to work on. Download the assignment as usual. You will not be able to use the *"Preview"* button, since the assignment is not visible to students. So instead we use the vocareum interface as follows: 
* click the *"Configure Workspace"* 
* click "Student View" 

From here you can use the interface as you usually would.
